{
    "photo": "-any logo string representation here-",
    "dark": "color name",
    "light": "color name",
    "width": "number",
    "text": "text",
    "maskPattern":"number"
}
using postman or any similar behavior application that allows you to send requests, send a request containing one of the following:
1)[photo, text, dark color, light color, mask pattern, width] => you will get 200 OK response with a String representation of an image containing the text QR code with the predefined parameters with a photo (logo)at it's center.
2)[text, dark color, light color, mask pattern, width] => you will get 200 OK response with a String representation of an image containing the text QR code with the predefined parameters.

***********************************
Notes
***********************************
-If the you didn't send any of the parameters except the text => you will get 200 OK response with a String representation of an image containing the text QR code with the predefined parameters and default values.

-if the width was too small to occupy the QR code it will be neglected. 

-if any of the two colors was not sent in the request it will use the default colors (black and white).

-if any of the two colors names was not correct => a 400 Internal Server Error response will be sent with error message: please enter a valid color.

-if the dark color sent in the request wasn't darker than the light color => a 400 Internal Server Error response will be sent with error message: Sorry the dark color must be darker than the light color.

-if the maskPattern is smaller than 0 o bigger than 7 => a 400 Internal Server Error response will sent with error message: maskPattern must be a number between 0-7.

********************
